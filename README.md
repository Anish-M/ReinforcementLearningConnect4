# Reinforcement Learning Connect4
Independent Study and Mentorship II


Product Proposal

Introduction and Statement of Purpose
Machine learning is a vast field with many subcategories. From computer vision to natural language processing, its applications are endless. In the past decade, deep learning, a subset of machine learning, has especially gained popularity due to the availability of data and increase in processing powers and capacity. 

With my final product, I hope to use reinforcement learning and deep learning neural networks to create a machine learning agent that can play a game. Specifically, I hope to explore how to create a neural network that can learn to play Connect 4. By achieving this goal, I hope to show machine learning can be used to learn the simple physics of the real world and how this can be scaled to larger applications. 
Review of Skills and Research

The research topics that will be instrumental for the creation of my topic will be reinforcement learning. Reinforcement learning is commonly used in the creation of AI for games as it builds a software that can learn the right steps to take through rewards and penalties. By doing so, it is able to optimize its rewards by taking the right steps, and, thus, playing the game. 

The skills needed will be a stronger understanding of python in general. More specifically, however, I hope to master the intricacies of python libraries and API to effectively create a program for the Connect 4 game. Additionally, I will need to understand and implement neural networks and reinforcement learning algorithms. This may also require understanding multivariable calculus and python libraries such as Tensorflow, PyTorch, SciKit Learn, and Numpy. This paper will also assist my understanding and research: https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~vmnih/docs/dqn.pdf

Methodology 
Materials: There are no specific materials I plan to use. I will use the PyCharm development environment on the MacOS operating system on my laptop to develop my final product. 

Description of Process and Procedures: I first plan to set up the game environment of Connect 4 in my IDE. Then I plan to configure a neural network and a Q-learning bot by creating a way to store the states of the game. I then will build a neural network for the Q table to represent these states and program the agent to use the Q-Learning algorithm to update the q-table. By repeating this process of learning, the program can explore all the states and actions and make further decisions to play the game correctly. I plan to model the program with a markov decision process to describe the flow of rewards, states, and actions. 





Utilization of Higher-Level Thinking Skills: Problem-solving is often needed in computer science to debug the programs. But the core of the entire process lies in designing the most efficient algorithm and neural network to accomplish the task. I will also use the evaluation higher level thinking skill to evaluate how well my program works in playing the game. I can use measures of score to evaluate accuracy and adjust my design as needed. I can also use higher level thinking skills to evaluate the outputs through a value function and the best value that it can achieve. 

Conclusion: My ideal outcome was for the algorithm to allow the game to continuously play games and win every time. This would be because I hope that the program can run flawlessly and completely learn how to play the game forever and currently predict and execute its next moves. The goal of this would be to demonstrate a use of reinforcement learning and how learning from the environment can be used to develop programs that can absorb from our daily life. As mentioned in the introduction, an example would be for a machine learning agent to understand the physics in our world and implement it in more complex scenarios. This field of computer science is still being explored and would be intended to benefit current computer scientists. Reinforcement learning can also be used for robotic controls and other smart devices.
